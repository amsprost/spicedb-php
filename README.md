# Authzed PHP Client

[![Docs](https://img.shields.io/badge/docs-authzed.com-%234B4B6C "Authzed Documentation")](https://docs.authzed.com)

This repository houses the PHP client library for Authzed and SpiceDB.

[SpiceDB] is a database system for managing security-critical permissions checking.

SpiceDB acts as a centralized service that stores authorization data.
Once stored, data can be performantly queried to answer questions such as "Does this user have access to this resource?" and "What are all the resources this user has access to?".

[Authzed] operates the globally available, serverless database platform for SpiceDB.

Supported client API versions:
- [v1](https://buf.build/authzed/api/docs/main/authzed.api.v1)

You can find more info about the API in the [Authzed Documentation API Reference] or the [Authzed API Buf Registry repository].
